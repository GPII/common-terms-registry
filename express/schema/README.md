This directory contains the [JSON Schemas](http://json-schema.org/) that JSON data returned by the Common Terms Registry API conform to, as well as a convenience library for working with schemas.

The "schemas" directory is meant to be exposed to end users using the [express.static middleware](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static).
