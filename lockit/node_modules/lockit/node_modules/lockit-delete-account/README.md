# delete account middleware for lockit

Express middleware for deleting user accounts. It is part of the lockit package.

## Installation

`npm install lockit-delete-account`

```js
var config = require('./config.js');
var deleteAccount = require('lockit-delete-account');
var app = express();

// express settings
// ...

// sessions are required - either cookie or some sort of db
app.use(express.cookieParser('your secret here'));
app.use(express.cookieSession());
app.use(app.router);

// use middleware after router so it doesn't interfere with your own routes
deleteAccount(app, config);

// serve static files as last middleware
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

```

## What do I get?

 - [GET /delete-account](#get-delete-account)
 - [POST /delete-account](#post-delete-account)

#### GET /delete-account

 - render template with input fields for `username`, `phrase` and `password`

#### POST /delete-account

 - verify that input fields aren't empty
 - check if `phrase` matches "please delete my account forever"
 - confirm that `username` matches session on server
 - find `username` in database
 - compare provided `password` with hash from database
 - kill session on server
 - delete user from database
 - render success message

## Test

JavaScript files are hinted during tests and module is tested with Mocha. You need to have a CouchDB instance running 
with the settings specified at `./test/config.js`. To start the test simply run the default Grunt task.
