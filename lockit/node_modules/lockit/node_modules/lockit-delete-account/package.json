  "readme": "# delete account middleware for lockit\n\nExpress middleware for deleting user accounts. It is part of the lockit package.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install lockit-delete-account`\n\n```js\nvar config = require('./config.js');\nvar deleteAccount = require('lockit-delete-account');\nvar app = express();\n\n// express settings\n// ...\n\n// sessions are required - either cookie or some sort of db\napp.use(express.cookieParser('your secret here'));\napp.use(express.cookieSession());\napp.use(app.router);\n\n// use middleware after router so it doesn't interfere with your own routes\ndeleteAccount(app, config);\n\n// serve static files as last middleware\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\n\n```\n\n## What do I get?\n\n - [GET /delete-account](#get-delete-account)\n - [POST /delete-account](#post-delete-account)\n\n#### GET /delete-account\n\n - render template with input fields for `username`, `phrase` and `password`\n\n#### POST /delete-account\n\n - verify that input fields aren't empty\n - check if `phrase` matches \"please delete my account forever\"\n - confirm that `username` matches session on server\n - find `username` in database\n - compare provided `password` with hash from database\n - kill session on server\n - delete user from database\n - render success message\n\n## Test\n\nJavaScript files are hinted during tests and module is tested with Mocha. You need to have a CouchDB instance running \nwith the settings specified at `./test/config.js`. To start the test simply run the default Grunt task.\n\n`grunt`\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2013 [Mirco Zeiss](mailto: mirco.zeiss@gmail.com)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
