The terms registry is intended to help people describing needs and solutions translate between the range of 
terms used to describe both.  The registry consists of canonical entries and aliases from other namespaces.

To set up a development instance of the registry, you will need:

* couchdb
* node.js
* the couchapp python script (from couchapp.org)

Once you have those, to create the required data, either sync from the live registry or import a copy of the 
original CSV file (check the "scripts" folder for scripts and details).

Once you have data, use couchapp to install the reference application and views (check the "couchapp" folder
for details).
