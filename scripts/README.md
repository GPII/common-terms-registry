The import directory contains scripts and instructions for the initial data import into the Preference Terms Dictionary.  These scripts were intended to be run once, and are only useful in pulling updates from the master spreadsheets.  They have been preserved only as a reference.

Most people will want to start with a newer data set using the instructions in the couchapp directory.

The maintenance directory contains scripts used to groom the data periodically.  These scripts are meant to be run regularly through a cron job, et cetera.
