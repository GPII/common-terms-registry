The import directory contains scripts and instructions for the initial data import into the terms registry.  These scripts were intended to be run once, and are no longer useful.  They have been preserved only as a reference.  To obtain a working data set, see the instructions in the couchapp directory.

The maintenance directory contains scripts used to groom the data periodically.  These scripts are meant to be run regularly through a cron job, et cetera.
